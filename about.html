        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Hogwarts Express was established by the Ministry of Magic as the
            best way to deliver young wizards and their professors to the
            concealed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controversial idea of using muggles' invention was introduced
            by Ottaline Gambol. Comparing to the former approaches it is appeared
            to be more safe, comfortable, concealed from muggles' eyes and easy
            for the young wizards, especially for those whose parents are muggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless the initial resistance from pure-blood families, Hogwarts
            Express satisfied all the requirements to solve the transportation
            problem. Before that Hogwarts students had to take a huge risk of being
            discovered by muggles, using their broomsticks (not to mention the dropping
            chests with school supplies) or injured, using Portkeys and Floo Network.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1830, the Ministry of Magic performed the biggest Concealment
            Charm ever performed in Britain, as well as one hundred and sixty-seven
            Memory Charms to acquire the locomotive. This operation also brought
            the Hogsmeade railway station.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1850s, the most proficient wizards in the Ministry created the platform
            9 3/4 at King's Cross Station and therefore finished the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hogwarts Express carries hundreds of students, providing the best
            experience to start each school year with friends, treats and waiting
            for the new adventure to start.

                    You should try it unless you're a muggle. Just because you
                    will not be able to use it.

                            I prefer flying motorcycles, because when I grew up, I became to big for the train seats.
                            But I remember my travel to Hogwarts. It was very exciting. And also this transport is
                            pet friendly, which is very important to me.
