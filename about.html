        <p>
            Hogwarts Express was established by the Ministry of Magic as the
            best way to deliver young wizards and their professors to the
            concealed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controversial idea of using muggles' invention was introduced
            by Ottaline Gambol. Comparing to the former approaches it is appeared
            to be more safe, comfortable, concealed from muggles' eyes and easy
            for the young wizards, especially for those whose parents are muggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless the initial resistance from pure-blood families, Hogwarts
            Express satisfied all the requirements to solve the transportation
            problem. Before that Hogwarts students had to take a huge risk of being
            discovered by muggles, using their broomsticks (not to mention the dropping
            chests with school supplies) or injured, using Portkeys and Floo Network.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1830, the Ministry of Magic performed the biggest Concealment
            Charm ever performed in Britain, as well as one hundred and sixty-seven
            Memory Charms to acquire the locomotive. This operation also brought
            the Hogsmeade railway station.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1850s, the most proficient wizards in the Ministry created the platform
            9 3/4 at King's Cross Station and therefore finished the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hogwarts Express carries hundreds of students, providing the best
            experience to start each school year with friends, treats and waiting
            for the new adventure to start.

                    Hogwarts Express is more than just a means of transportation. It has become a symbol
                    of unity and friendship, as it is during this train journey that young Hogwarts students
                    make new friends and plan their future adventures. The carriages are filled with laughter,
                    whispers, and anticipation of what awaits them at school.
                    It is a place where magic comes to life, and dreams become reality.

                    This train is a source of nostalgia and magic that was an integral part of my education
                    at Hogwarts. Every time I step foot onto the carriage of the Hogwarts Express, I feel
                    genuine joy and anticipation of new adventures. I cannot fail to mention the breathtaking
                    landscapes that can be seen outside the windows of the Hogwarts Express. The green meadows,
                    enchanting forests, and distant mountains create an unparalleled scene that fills me with
                    delight and reminds me that I am a true part of the magical world.

                    The Hogwarts Express is a symbol of the past, reminding me of the times when I was young
                    and proud as a student of Hogwarts. The journey on this train was always exhilarating and,
                    at the same time, stimulating, as it promised new encounters, lessons, and experiences.
                    However, despite these positive aspects, the Hogwarts Express also reminds me of the
                    challenges and divisions I experienced during that time. Being a significant part of the
                    wizarding world, the train always reminded me of my family legacy and the expectations
                    that hung over me.

                    Hogwarts Express is not just a place of memories; it is a place of hope. It embodies
                    the connection between the past and the future, allowing me to relive the magic and
                    reconnect with my roots.
                    Now, I look upon the Hogwarts Express with gratitude and serenity. This train will
                    always remind me of my journey, the obstacles overcome, and the importance of staying
                    true to myself and my values.

                    The Hogwarts Express also embodies my childhood memories. The sounds of the rumbling
                    wheels, the whistle of the steam engine, and the scent of fresh air evoke emotions
                    and open the door to the past. Here, I feel the innocence and spontaneity that are
                    inherent to childhood.
                    But most importantly, the Hogwarts Express symbolizes friendship and solidarity.
                    The carriages are filled with laughter, conversations, and anticipation. It is where
                    I learned the value of support and mutual assistance, which undoubtedly helped us
                    overcome all obstacles on our journey.
                    It is not just a mode of transportation; it is a magical journey that will always
                    remain in my heart. I am grateful to this train for the unforgettable moments and
                    for the opportunity to be part of the wonderful world of magic and friendship.

                            I prefer flying motorcycles, because when I grew up, I became to big for the train seats.
                            But I remember my travel to Hogwarts. It was very exciting. And also this transport is
                            pet friendly, which is very important to me.
